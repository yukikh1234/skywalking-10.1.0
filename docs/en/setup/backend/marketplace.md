# Marketplace

**Marketplace** is the first UI menu on the SkyWalking native UI.

The native out-of-box features are listed in the marketplace. Follow the `Documentation` guidance to set up the required components.
Once SkyWalking detects the services of those layers, the relative menu will show up on the left automatically.

If you prefer to have a custom dashboard to visualize your metrics, logs, and traces in your private setup, you need to 
1. Follow Tracing, Logging, and Metrics documentation to set up codes.
2. Follow Customization documentation to add analysis pipeline.
3. Follow [UI Customization Setup documentation](../../ui/README.md) to set up new UI dashboards.
